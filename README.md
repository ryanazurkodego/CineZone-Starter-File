# CineZone Website Development Project

## Introduction
Welcome to the CineZone Website Development Project! This hands-on project is an opportunity to enhance your web development skills by integrating Vanilla JavaScript with The Movie Database (TMDB) API. You'll transform a static HTML template into a dynamic website showcasing movies and TV shows information.

## Project Overview
CineZone is a fictitious platform that provides updated information on movies and TV shows. Key features include:
- Now Playing Movies Slider
- Popular Movies and TV Shows Sections
- Search Functionality for Movies and TV Shows
- Detailed Information Pages for Individual Movies and TV Shows

## Objectives
Your main tasks in this project are to:
1. **API Integration**: Sign up for an account on TMDB and obtain an API key. Use this key to fetch and display data from TMDB on the CineZone website.
2. **Dynamic Content Creation**: Utilize Vanilla JavaScript to convert the static HTML content into dynamic elements. This includes displaying now-playing and popular movies/TV shows, implementing search functionality, and showing detailed information pages.

## Specific Requirements
- **Movie Details**: Include Movie Title, Rating, Release Date, Description, Genres, a Button to Visit Movie Homepage, and Movie Info (Budget, Revenue, Runtime, Status, Production Companies).
- **TV Show Details**: Include Show Name, Rating, Release Date, Description, Genres, a Button to Visit Show Homepage, and Show Info (Number of Episodes, Last Episode to Air, Status, Production Companies).
- **Search Feature**: Implement a search feature to find movies or TV shows. Display results with pagination.
- **Responsive Design**: Ensure the website is responsive and functions well on different devices.

## Additional Resources
- **Fonts**: Fonts are included in the `webfonts` folder.
- **Libraries**: The `lib` folder contains `fontawesome`, `swiper.css`, and `swiper.js`. Familiarize yourself with the `swiper.js` documentation and utilize it for the slider implementation.
- **Styling**: Starter/base styling is available in the `CSS` folder with `style.css` and `spinner.css`. Use `spinner.css` for loading indicators before displaying API data.
- **Images**: The `images` folder contains `no-image.jpg`, which should be used for movies or TV shows without available images.

## Getting Started
- Clone or download the starter HTML file from the repository.
- Familiarize yourself with the TMDB API documentation and endpoints.
- Plan your JavaScript code structure to efficiently manage API requests and DOM manipulation.

## Submission Guidelines
- After completing the project, upload your code to a GitHub repository.
- Ensure your project includes all necessary files and is free from bugs.
- Submit the link to your GitHub repository through Canvas or the provided Google Form.

## Evaluation Criteria
- Functionality: Accurate API integration and working dynamic features.
- Code Quality: Clean, well-organized, and documented JavaScript code.
- UI/UX Design: User-friendly interface and responsive design.
- Creativity: Unique approaches in feature implementation and design.

## Conclusion
This project is an excellent way to apply and showcase your skills in JavaScript and API interaction. We're excited to see how you bring the CineZone website to life!
